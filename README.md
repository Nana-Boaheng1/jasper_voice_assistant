# JASPER: Just A Speech-based Personal Electronic Resource

JASPER is a voice assistant that can play songs, tell time, provide the current date, check the weather, sing, tell jokes, and perform simple mathâ€”all through voice commands.

## Usage

1. Run the JASPER application:

   ```bash
   python jasper.py
   ```

   This will start the graphical user interface (GUI) for JASPER.

2. JASPER will greet you and await your command. Simply speak to JASPER in a clear voice to initiate different actions.

### Additional Steps

- **Customization:**
  Before using JASPER, you can customize it by setting your name. When JASPER starts, it will prompt you to provide your name. Speak your name clearly, and JASPER will remember it for future interactions.

- **Exit Command:**
  If you want to exit JASPER, simply say "exit" during any interaction, and JASPER will gracefully close the application.

### Libraries and Dependencies

Make sure you have the required libraries and dependencies installed before running JASPER. You can install them using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
